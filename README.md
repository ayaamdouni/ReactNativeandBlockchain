# Getting Started

This project explores the integration of React Native with blockchain technology. I established a connection between the application and my local wallet using **WalletConnect**, and subsequently interacted with a smart contract utilizing the **Wagmi** library.

## For further insights into this code, you can refer to [my Medium article](https://medium.com/p/f827d35ef1fc).

>**Note**: Make sure you have a wallet installed on your phone before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```
